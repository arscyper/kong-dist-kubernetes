Kong can easily be provisioned to Kubernetes cluster using the following steps:

1. **Initial setup**:
    
    Skip to step 2 if you already provisioned a cluster and registered it with Kubernetes.
    
    ## Deploy a GKE cluster
    
    You would need [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) and [kubectl](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/quickstart#install_the_gcloud_command-line_interface) command-line tools installed and set up to run deployment commands. Also make sure your Google Cloud account has at least two STATIC_ADDRESSES available. 

    Download or clone the repo

    ```bash
    $ git clone git@github.com:Mashape/kong-dist-kubernetes.git
    $ cd kong-dist-kubernetes
    ```

    Using `cluster.yaml`, deploy a GKE cluster to use for deploying the solution later. Fill in the following information before deploying:
    
    * desired cluster name
    * zone in which to run the cluster
    * basicauth username and password for authenticating access to the cluster

    When ready, deploy with the following command:

    ```bash
    $ gcloud deployment-manager deployments create cluster --config cluster.yaml
    ```

2. **Deploy a Kong supported Database**

    
    ## Cassandra

    Using `cassandra.yaml` deploy a Cassandra `Service` and a `ReplicationController` to the cluster created in the last step.	

    When ready, deploy with the following command:

    ```bash
    $ kubectl create -f cassandra.yaml
    ```
    
   ## Postgres
   
    Using `postgres.yaml` deploy a Postges `Service` and a `ReplicationController` to the cluster created in the last step.

    When ready, deploy with the following command:

    ```bash
    $ kubectl create -f postgres.yaml
    ```
   

3. **Deploying Kong on the cluster**

    Using `kong.yaml`, deploy a  Kong `Service` and a `Deployment` to the cluster created in the last step. Update the
    environment variable `KONG_DNS_RESOLVER` with the IP of the DNS resolver you want use or Kubernetes `kube-dns` IP. Use following 
    command to get the `kube-dns` IP
    
    ```bash
    $ kubectl get svc kube-dns --namespace=kube-system | grep kube-dns | awk '{print $2}'
    ``` 
    When ready, deploy with the following command:

    ```bash
    $ kubectl create -f kong.yaml
    ```

3. **Verifying deployment**

    Now you can see the resources that have been deployed using `kubectl`:

    ```bash
    $ kubectl get rc
    $ kubectl get deployment
    $ kubectl get pods
    $ kubectl get services
    $ kubectl get logs <pod-name>
    ```
    Once the `EXTERNAL_IP` is available for Kong Proxy and Admin services, you can test Kong:

    ```bash
    $ curl <admin-ip-address>:8001
    $ curl <proxy-ip-address>:8000
    ```

3. **Using Kong:**

## Important Note

When deploying into a Kubernetes cluster with Deployment Manager, it is
important to be aware that deleting `ReplicationController` Kubernetes objects
**does not delete its underlying pods**, and it is your responisibility to
manage the destruction of these resources when deleting or updating a
`ReplicationController` in your configuration.
